# Bambu Lab to Snapmaker U1 Converter

A web-based tool to convert Bambu Lab .3mf projects to Snapmaker U1 format, preserving multi-color painting and filament assignments.

**Live version:** [https://bl2u1.nbn.cat](https://bl2u1.nbn.cat)

## Features

- Converts Bambu Lab/Bambu Studio .3mf files to Snapmaker U1 compatible format
- Preserves color painting and multi-color assignments
- Applies the 0.20mm Standard print profile for U1
- Remaps filament types to U1 compatible profiles
- Automatically enables Tree Supports (auto) if the original model has supports enabled
- Supports up to 4 filaments/colors
- Simple drag & drop interface
- No installation required (web-based)

## How It Works

1. Upload your Bambu Lab .3mf file
2. Review and adjust filament colors/types if needed
3. Click "Convert and Download"
4. Open the converted file in **[Snapmaker Orca](https://github.com/Snapmaker/OrcaSlicer/releases/latest)** for final slicing

## Integration with Snapmaker Orca

bl2u1 is designed to work hand-in-hand with **[Snapmaker Orca](https://github.com/Snapmaker/OrcaSlicer)**, the official slicer for Snapmaker printers (a fork of OrcaSlicer). The two tools form a complete Bambu → U1 workflow:

| Step | Tool |
|------|------|
| Design & multi-color paint | Bambu Studio / BambuStudio |
| Export `.3mf` project | Bambu Studio |
| **Convert to U1 format** | **bl2u1 (this tool)** |
| Slice & send to printer | **Snapmaker Orca** |

### Getting Snapmaker Orca

Download the latest release from the [Snapmaker/OrcaSlicer releases page](https://github.com/Snapmaker/OrcaSlicer/releases/latest).
It ships with built-in Snapmaker machine profiles and the full library of compatible filament presets.

### Keeping Filament Profiles in Sync

The `sync_profiles.py` script fetches the current Snapmaker filament profile list directly from the OrcaSlicer repository,
so you can keep `filament_types.3mf` aligned with whichever Orca version you have installed:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only needed once)
pip install requests

# Print current OrcaSlicer Snapmaker filament profiles to stdout
python sync_profiles.py

# Save to a JSON file for inspection / further processing
python sync_profiles.py --output profiles.json

# With a GitHub token to avoid rate-limiting
python sync_profiles.py --token <your_token> --output profiles.json
```

## Self-Hosting

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Flask

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/josua/bl2u1.git
cd bl2u1

# Install dependencies
pip install flask

# Run the application
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Project Structure

```

├── app.py                    # Flask backend
├── sync_profiles.py          # Fetch filament profiles from OrcaSlicer repo
├── templates/

├── uploads/                  # Temporary file storage (auto-cleaned)
├── u1_template.3mf           # U1 template without supports
├── u1_template_supports.3mf  # U1 template with tree supports
└── filament_types.3mf        # Available filament profiles
```

### Template Files

The converter requires template .3mf files configured for Snapmaker U1:

- `u1_template.3mf` - Base template with 0.20mm Standard profile, supports disabled
- `u1_template_supports.3mf` - Same as above but with Tree Supports (auto) enabled
- `filament_types.3mf` - Reference file containing available U1 filament profiles

## Technical Details

The converter performs the following transformations:

1. **Printer Profile**: Changes printer settings from Bambu Lab to Snapmaker U1
2. **Filament Mapping**: Remaps filament types to U1 compatible profiles
3. **Color Preservation**: Maintains all color painting data from the original file
4. **Support Detection**: Checks `different_settings_to_system` for `enable_support` and uses the appropriate template
5. **Filament Padding**: Ensures 4 filaments are always configured (fills empty slots with white PLA)

### File Cleanup

Uploaded files are automatically deleted after 8 hours to save disk space.

## Limitations

- Maximum 4 filaments/colors (U1 hardware limitation)
- The converted file must be sliced in Snapmaker Orca before printing
- Some advanced Bambu-specific features may not transfer
